    This site is designed to extract SVGs that are embedded inside a webpage
  </p>
  <p>
    That is any SVGs that have been added to page directly using the svg html
    tag. It will not find SVGs that are linked within an img tag, as these are
    easily extractable by right clicking and clicking save image as.
  </p>
  <p>
    The effectiveness of this website depends on the target website, as some
    websites will be written using technologies that make it impossible to find
    the SVGs, though it will try its best
